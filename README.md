# Loan Prediction on LendingClub Issued Loans Dataset

This project was developed for the Visual Analytics course of the Bachelor's degree in Mathematical Engineering in Data Science.

## DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT AND EXPECTED BENEFITS
* Develop a classification model to predict if a future customer will pay back the loan
* Create a training dataset formed by internal data without outliers
* Create a cluster method to identify main characteristics of customers that paid back the loan or not
